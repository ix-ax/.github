# Repositories from this organization have been moved under [Inxton](https://github.com/Inxton) organization, where they will remain open sourced, developed, and mantainded by the same team of developers.

<!--
# Welcome Aboard IX Organization

We develop innovative tools designed to interact seamlessly with the new, state-of-the-art platform from Siemens - SIMATIC AX.

Key repositories:

- **AX#**: Bridging the gap between the PLC sphere and higher-level frameworks (.NET).
- **AXOpen**: A robust application framework that empowers you to craft cutting-edge industrial automation applications.

The credit for the projects that live within our organization goes to a diverse ensemble of software developers and industrial automation engineers from [MTS](https://www.mts.sk/en/). Our mission is not only to share our accumulated expertise with a global community of automation engineers who share our passion, but also to extend an invitation to those looking to join this creative endeavour.

**As SIMATIC AX is currently in a limited release phase, kindly take note of the following:**

**It is necessary to have a valid license for SIMATIC AX in order to use AX# and AXOpen!**  
SIMATIC AX is currently in a limited sales release in selected European countries only. You will need to request access from the AX team which will check if your use case is suitable for the current state of the product. The first step to getting the approval is contacting your local SIEMENS sales representative or writing an email to [simatic-ax@siemens.com](mailto:simatic-ax@siemens.com?subject=Request%20for%20access%20|%20SIMATIC%20AX%20for%20IX).
